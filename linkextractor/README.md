# Link Extractor

The Link Extractor application scrapes hyperlinks from a given web page.
This repository illustrates a step by step approach to learn [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

It starts from running a very basic script and gradually leads to a multi-service container orchestration (AKA micro-service architecture).

## How to Use the Repository

1. [Play with Docker Classroom](https://training.play-with-docker.com/microservice-orchestration/) helps to start your Docker exploration journey without any additional overhead of installing and configuring Docker locally.
2. Alternatively, if running on a local Docker installation, follow instructions in the `README` files of various folders from `step0` to `step6` and explore corresponding code.
To run illustrated codes `Docker` and `Compose` need to be installed on the machine.
